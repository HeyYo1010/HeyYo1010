# 👋 Hi, I'm Yoyo 🌈

I'm a passionate **Full Stack Software Engineer** with a love for building scalable web applications and innovative AI solutions that enhance human capabilities.

### Why Full Stack?

For me, being a Full Stack Software Engineer means having the ability to analyze business needs and craft products that meet those needs. Whether it's backend or frontend, I believe in learning and building whatever is necessary to bring a project to life. In the age of AI, the possibilities for learning and development are limitless, empowering us to create independently.

I have a strong background in both frontend and backend development, and I thrive on turning ideas into reality through code.
